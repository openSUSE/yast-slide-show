<section label="09_security">
 <title>Your operating system – respecting privacy – providing security</title>

  <para>openSUSE builds something that puts you in control. Rolling or Stable,
  you decide. Unlike Windows, you decide which updates get applied when.
  Unlike most distros, you decide which desktop you want (or none at all),
  you have tools like YaST to help you configure your machine and control your
  security and privacy. Secure your system and data from Internet intruders with
  SUSE Firewall. This security device is activated by default and easy to configure.
  But you can do even more to protect your system with openSUSE &suse-version;
  because it also includes AppArmor, the most effective and
  easy-to-use Linux application security system available today.
  AppArmor proactively protects your operating system and applications from
  internal or external threats.</para>

<!-- for the online update feature, see bnc#793710 -->
<para>In addition to SUSE Firewall and AppArmor, openSUSE &suse-version; also 
includes a special security patch update system. To ensure that the latest security
patches are installed on your system, you can choose to perform an
online update at the end of this installation procedure (if you did not
choose the automatic installation modus at the beginning). And in the
future, you will be automatically informed of the availability of
important security updates, so you can install them at your convenience.
